# Portfolio Page: Professional Materials
# Unit 08 Project 1 Homework: Professional Materials

My goal was to make a simple and aesthetically pleasing website showing my path to become a full stack developer.  The website consists of 3 sections- Portfolio, About and Contact with smooth scrolling and animated effects when clicking on the 6 projects.  I wrote a brief intro, provide contact info, a link to my pdf resume and my Linkedin profile.

## 

It's a mobile-first website.  It's updated with my coding portfolio featuring project 1 and 5 homework assignments. The portfolio has 6 projects with projects titles, screenshots of app, link to github page repository and deployed versions. The apps are pinned on my Github page along with my updated information such as profile pic, bio, links and email.
